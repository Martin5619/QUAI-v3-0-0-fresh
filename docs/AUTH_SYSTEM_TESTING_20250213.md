## Test Phase 1: Existing User Login
### Test Case: Login with test1221@quai.com
- Status: ✅ PASSED
- Time: 2025-02-13T09:44:28Z
- Results:
  - Successfully logged in
  - Redirected to dashboard
  - Dashboard components render (with some UI issues to be addressed later)

## Test Phase 2: New User Registration
### Test Case: Create Account test1331@quai.com
- Status: IN PROGRESS
- Time: 2025-02-13T09:51:37Z
- Test Steps:
  1. Visit /auth/signup
  2. Enter credentials:
     - Email: test1331@quai.com
     - Password: Test1234!
  3. Complete registration
  4. Verify onboarding flow
  5. Check dashboard access

### Expected Results

   - Should guide through setup steps
   - Should mark onboarding as complete

3. Dashboard Access:
   - Should redirect to dashboard after onboarding

## Test Session: 2025-02-13T09:59:48Z
### Context
- Recent migration from `documentsCount` to `documentsUsed` in Usage schema
- Testing authentication system integrity post-changes

### Test Cases
1. New User Registration
   - Email: test1441@quai.com
   - Password: Test1234!
   - Expected: Complete onboarding with correct usage data structure

2. Existing User Sign In
   - Email: test1221@quai.com
   - Expected: Successful login and correct usage data display

### Status
- Test in Progress
- Awaiting results

### Recovery Point
- Created before testing
- Database backup verified
- Code changes documented

### Notes
- Testing conducted after field name standardization
- Focus on usage data integrity
- Monitoring onboarding completion

## Field Name Migration - Phase 2 (2025-02-13)

#### Changes Made
1. Updated `questionsCount` to `questionsGenerated` in:
   - `src/app/api/user/onboarding/complete/route.ts`
   - `src/components/onboarding/onboarding-wizard.tsx`
   - `src/app/api/user/usage/route.ts`

#### Testing Status
- [x] Schema validation updated
- [x] Usage creation during onboarding updated
- [x] Usage tracking endpoints updated
- [ ] Testing with new user account pending

### Test Account Creation - Round 2 (2025-02-13T10:05:58Z)
- Test Email: `test1551@quai.com`
- Password: `Test1234!`
- Purpose: Verify field name migration (`questionsGenerated`)
- Status: In Progress

#### Test Steps:
1. Create new account
2. Complete onboarding process
3. Verify usage data creation
4. Check field names in database

#### Expected Results:
- Account creation successful
- Usage data created with correct field names
- No errors during onboarding process

### Schema Issue Fix (2025-02-13T10:08:46Z)
#### Issue
- Onboarding completion failed due to invalid field `role` in `OnboardingState_v3` model
- Error indicated schema mismatch between code and database

#### Analysis
1. `role` field belongs to `User_v3` model, not `OnboardingState_v3`
2. Need to separate user updates from onboarding state updates
3. Usage data needs to be created separately

#### Fix Applied
1. Moved role update to `User_v3` model
2. Simplified `OnboardingState_v3` update to only include relevant fields
3. Created separate usage record creation
4. Maintained proper transaction order:
   - Update user first
   - Then update onboarding state
   - Finally create usage record

#### Testing Status
- [x] Code changes applied
- [ ] Testing with test account (test1551@quai.com)
- [ ] Verify user role update
- [ ] Verify usage data creation

### Onboarding Flow Architecture (2025-02-13T10:14:27Z)
#### Role Selection Process
1. **Initial State**
   - User starts with role undefined
   - Account state: `CREATED`
   - Role selection happens at Welcome step

2. **Welcome Step**
   - User selects role via role cards (Personal, Teacher, etc.)
   - Currently implementing Personal User flow
   - Role is set on selection, not at completion
   - Future-proofed for additional roles (Teacher, Institution Admin, etc.)

3. **Plan Selection Step**
   - Currently defaulting to FREE plan
   - Plan is set during this step
   - Architecture supports future plan types (PRO, TEAM, ENTERPRISE)

4. **Dashboard Access**
   - Components and sections are role-dependent
   - UI adapts based on user's role and plan
   - Enables role-specific features and limitations

#### Role States
- Initial: `undefined` or `null`
- Personal: `PERSONAL_USER`
- Future States:
  - `TEACHER`
  - `INSTITUTION_ADMIN`
  - `SYSTEM_ADMIN`
  - `CORPORATE_USER`

#### Fix Required (2025-02-13T10:14:27Z)
Recent changes need adjustment to:
1. Move role selection back to Welcome step
2. Maintain role state through onboarding
3. Only update non-role fields at completion

#### Current Test
- Test Account: test1661@quai.com
- Password: Test1234!
- Purpose: Verify role selection and state management
- Status: Pending test

#### Implementation Notes
1. Role selection must persist through steps
2. Plan selection remains separate from role
3. Dashboard must check both role and plan for UI decisions
4. Account settings will allow role changes post-onboarding

### Schema Mismatch Issue (2025-02-13T10:17:19Z)
#### Error Analysis
1. Attempted to use `completedAt` field in `OnboardingState_v3` model
2. Field not defined in Prisma schema
3. Error: `Unknown argument 'completedAt'`

#### Server Restart Protocol (from DOITRIGHT)
1. **Before Restart**
   - Save all changes
   - Document current state
   - Note any active processes

2. **Restart Steps**
   ```bash
   # 1. Kill existing processes
   npx kill-port 3002 3000
   
   # 2. Clear Next.js cache
   rm -rf .next

   # 3. Rebuild and restart
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **After Restart**
   - Verify server is running
   - Check database connection
   - Test affected endpoints

#### Schema Fix Required
1. Remove `completedAt` from onboarding completion logic
2. Use existing fields:
   - `isComplete`: Boolean
   - `updatedAt`: DateTime (automatic)
   - Store completion data in `profileData`

#### Test Account Status
- Email: test1661@quai.com
- Current State: Onboarding completion failed
- Error: Schema mismatch
- Next Step: Retry after schema fix

### Successful Onboarding Test (2025-02-13T10:24:57Z)
#### Test Account Details
- Email: `test1661@quai.com`
- Role: `PERSONAL_USER`
- Plan: `FREE`
- Status: ✓ Complete

#### Test Flow Verification
1. **Sign Up**
   - [x] Form submission successful
   - [x] User record created
   - [x] Initial state: `CREATED`

2. **Onboarding Process**
   - [x] Welcome step (Role selection)
   - [x] Profile step
   - [x] Plan selection (FREE)
   - [x] Usage setup
   - [x] Final completion

3. **Database State**
   - [x] User record updated
   - [x] Onboarding state completed
   - [x] Usage record initialized
   - [x] Account state: `ACTIVE`

#### Reversion Points
1. **Pre-Onboarding State**
   ```sql
   -- Revert user state
   UPDATE users_v3
   SET accountState = 'CREATED',
       role = null,
       plan = null
   WHERE email = 'test1661@quai.com';

   -- Remove onboarding state
   DELETE FROM onboarding_states_v3
   WHERE userId = '<user_id>';

   -- Remove usage data
   DELETE FROM usages_v3
   WHERE userId = '<user_id>';
   ```

2. **Mid-Onboarding State**
   ```sql
   UPDATE users_v3
   SET accountState = 'ONBOARDING'
   WHERE email = 'test1661@quai.com';

   UPDATE onboarding_states_v3
   SET isComplete = false,
       currentStep = 'welcome'
   WHERE userId = '<user_id>';
   ```

#### Recovery Procedures
1. **Database Backup**
   - Location: `C:\Users\marti\CascadeProjects\MongoDB Backups\QUAi-v3\20250213`
   - Timestamp: 2025-02-13T10:24:57Z
   - Collections: users_v3, onboarding_states_v3, usages_v3

2. **Code State**
   - Branch: `feature/auth-system-testing-20250213`
   - Commit: Onboarding completion fixes
   - Previous working state tagged

#### Next Phase
- [ ] Login process testing
- [ ] Session management verification
- [ ] Dashboard access validation
- [ ] Role-based UI verification

#### Implementation Notes
1. Role selection at Welcome step working as designed
2. Plan selection defaulting to FREE as specified
3. Dashboard components adapting to PERSONAL_USER role
4. All schema updates successful

Next steps:
1. Test onboarding process with new user account
2. Verify usage tracking with updated field names
3. Monitor for any remaining instances of old field names

## Notes
- This test is part of the auth system verification after UI component recovery
- Dashboard UI requires further review (noted separate issues)
- Previous dashboard changes from 2025-02-12 need to be recovered

## Status: IN PROGRESS
Priority: High - Core System Functionality
