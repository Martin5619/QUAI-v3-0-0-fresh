# Authentication Test Failure Analysis
Created: 2025-02-13T09:37:06Z

## Issue
Test endpoint `/api/auth/test` is failing due to UI component dependencies affecting the entire application build.

## Root Cause
NextJS is failing to build due to missing components that are imported in dashboard pages:
1. `@/components/icons/entity-icons`
2. `@/components/dashboard/actions/quick-action-center`
3. `@/components/dashboard/usage/usage-circles`

## Impact
- Cannot test authentication in isolation
- Build failures prevent any route from working
- Server returns 500 errors for all requests

## Solution Strategy

### Phase 1: Isolate Auth Testing
1. Create temporary stubs for missing components
2. Move dashboard to optional route
3. Create pure API test endpoint

### Phase 2: Component Recovery
1. Check all backup sources
2. Rebuild components if needed
3. Restore full dashboard functionality

## Action Plan

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Create stub components to allow build
   - Implement pure API auth test
   - Document component requirements

2. **Short Term**
   - Locate or rebuild missing components
   - Restore dashboard functionality
   - Update testing protocols

## Status: BLOCKING - BUILD FAILURE
Priority: Critical - Preventing All Testing
