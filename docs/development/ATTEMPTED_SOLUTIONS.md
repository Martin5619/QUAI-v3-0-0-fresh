## Failed Attempts Log

### Front Page Implementation (2025-02-09)
**Problem**: Front page layout changes without approval
**What Was Tried**: Direct modification of Hero section without backup
**Why It Failed**: 
- Lost original approved version
- No recovery point created
- Changes made without documentation
**What Worked Instead**: 
- Creating component backup first
- Getting explicit approval
- Using component-manager.ps1
**Recovery Point**: front-page-v3-approved-20250209
**LESSON**: NEVER modify approved components without:
1. Creating backup
2. Getting approval
3. Documenting changes
4. Setting recovery point

### Database Schema Changes (2025-02-08)
**Problem**: Attempted to share schemas between v2.4.16 and v3.0.0
**What Was Tried**: Reusing models without _v3 suffix
**Why It Failed**:
- Caused confusion between versions
- Created dependency issues
- Made rollback impossible
**What Worked Instead**:
- Clean _v3 suffix implementation
- Separate database collections
- Clear version separation
**Recovery Point**: schema-v3-clean-20250208

### Sign Up Page Implementation (2025-02-10)
**Problem**: V3 Sign Up page missing critical features from v2.4.16
**What Was Tried**: Created new SignupForm_v3 without feature parity
**Why It Failed**: 
- Lost Google SSO integration
- Missing password recovery
- No sign in/sign up toggle
- Incomplete auth features
**What Worked in v2.4.16**: 
- Complete auth features in SignUpForm.tsx
- Google SSO integration
- Password recovery links
- Clear navigation between auth states
**Recovery Point**: auth-v2.4.16-complete
**LESSON**: NEVER create V3 components without:
1. Full feature comparison with v2.4.16
2. Documenting all required features
3. Testing feature parity
4. Creating recovery points

## Current Blockers

### 1. Component Version Control
**Problem**: Risk of losing approved versions
**Solution Implementation**:
1. Use component-manager.ps1 for all changes
2. Create APPROVED_STATES.md tracking
3. Maintain version history
4. Regular backups

### 2. Feature Approval Process
**Problem**: Changes made without proper approval
**Solution Implementation**:
1. Document approval process
2. Create approval checkpoints
3. Maintain approved versions
4. Clear rollback paths

        [string]$AttemptedSolution,
        [string]$FailureReason,
        [string]$WorkingSolution,
        [string]$RecoveryPoint
    )
