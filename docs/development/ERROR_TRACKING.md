# Error Tracking and Resolution Log

## 2025-02-10 09:08 - Next.js Client Component Error

### Error Description
```
Failed to compile
./src/components/landing/LandingPage.tsx
You're importing a component that needs `useState`. This React hook only works in a client component.
```

### Root Cause
- Using React hooks (`useState`) in a server component
- Next.js App Router requires explicit client/server component declaration
- Components using React hooks must be marked as client components

### Resolution Steps
1. Add "use client" directive to components using React hooks
2. Ensure proper component hierarchy (client vs server)
3. Document component type in comments for clarity

### Prevention Strategy
1. Component Naming Convention:
   ```typescript
   // Client components: [Name].client.tsx
   // Server components: [Name].server.tsx
   // Default: [Name].tsx (server)
   ```

2. Component Documentation:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * @component LandingPage
    * @type Client Component
    * @uses React Hooks: useState
    * @requires "use client" directive
    */
   ```

3. Code Review Checklist:
   - [ ] Check for React hooks usage
   - [ ] Verify "use client" directive
   - [ ] Review component dependencies
   - [ ] Test client/server boundaries

### Recovery Point
- ID: landing-v3-client-fix
- Description: Added "use client" directive
- Dependencies: react, next.js
- Mobile considerations: No impact
