# Authentication System Testing
Created: 2025-02-13T09:17:45Z

## Context
- Post-database failures (2025-02-12)
- Document system rebuild
- Testing authentication integrity

## Test Branch
- Name: feature/auth-testing-20250213-0917
- Base: feature/prisma-recovery-20250213-0748
- Purpose: Verify authentication system post-recovery

## Test Scenarios

### 1. New User Registration
- Create new user account
- Verify email verification process
- Test onboarding flow
- Check user data in Prisma Studio

### 2. Existing User Sign In
- Test with known good account
- Verify session creation
- Check user data loading
- Validate permissions

## Recovery Points
1. Database Backup
   - Location: `C:\Users\marti\CascadeProjects\MongoDB Backups\QUAi-v3\20250213`
   - Contains: Full database snapshot
   - Time: Pre-testing state

2. Schema Backup
   - Location: `C:\Users\marti\CascadeProjects\Prisma Backups\QUAi-v3\20250213`
   - Contains: schema.prisma backup
   - Time: Pre-testing state

## Test Environment
- Development Server: http://localhost:3002
- Prisma Studio: http://localhost:5556
- Branch: feature/auth-testing-20250213-0917

## Test Data Required
1. New User Details:
   - To be provided during testing
   - Will include email, password, name

2. Existing User:
   - To be provided during testing
   - Known working account

## Monitoring Points
1. Database Operations
   - User creation
   - Session management
   - Relationship creation

2. Error Handling
   - Invalid credentials
   - Duplicate emails
   - Missing fields

3. Data Integrity
   - User model fields
   - Related models (Session, Account)
   - Onboarding state

## Reversion Process
1. **Quick Revert**
   ```powershell
   # Switch back to base branch
   git checkout feature/prisma-recovery-20250213-0748
   
   # Restore database if needed
   # (Instructions in MongoDB backup manifest)
   ```

2. **Clean Up**
   - Remove test users
   - Clear test sessions
   - Document any issues

## Questions for Testing:
1. Are there specific existing user accounts you'd like to test with?
2. Should we create multiple test users or focus on one?
3. Are there specific permissions or roles to test?
4. Should we test the password reset flow?

## Status: READY FOR TESTING
Priority: High - Critical System Verification
