## ⚠️ CRITICAL STATUS UPDATE - 2025-02-10 (Monday) ⚠️

### Current Blockers
1. **Authentication System Not Working**
   - NextAuth.js integration issues
   - Port 3002 conflicts
   - Dependencies version mismatches
   - Unable to complete registration flow

2. **Development Progress Blocked**
   - Cannot test onboarding flow
   - Dashboard implementation delayed
   - No progress on core features
   - User journey verification pending

### Attempted Solutions
1. **Authentication System**
   - Tried multiple NextAuth.js versions (4.22.1, 4.24.11)
   - Attempted dependency fixes with --legacy-peer-deps
   - Simplified auth configuration
   - Port conflict resolution attempts

2. **Code Organization**
   - Moved auth to standard Next.js location
   - Simplified registration endpoint
   - Removed complex features temporarily
   - Updated environment configuration

### Current State
1. **Authentication**
   - Location: `/src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
   - Status: Not Working
   - Error: Module resolution issues
   - Dependencies: Conflicts between Next.js and NextAuth.js

2. **Registration**
   - Location: `/src/app/api/auth/v3_2/register/route.ts`
   - Status: Untested
   - Features: Basic user creation
   - Missing: Email verification, hCaptcha

3. **Email Verification**
   - Location: `/src/app/auth/v3_2/verify-email/page.tsx`
   - Status: Not Working
   - Issues: Auto-signin failing
   - Dependencies: NextAuth.js problems

### Required Actions for Tomorrow
1. **Authentication Fix**
   1. Clean install of dependencies
   2. Verify Next.js and NextAuth.js compatibility
   3. Test each auth component separately
   4. Document working configuration

2. **Development Environment**
   1. Resolve port 3002 issues
   2. Clear development cache
   3. Verify environment variables
   4. Test server startup

3. **Feature Implementation**
   1. Fix authentication first
   2. Test registration flow
   3. Verify email verification
   4. Implement onboarding
   5. Begin dashboard work

### Critical Notes
1. **DO NOT**
   - Change port from 3002
   - Mix v2 and v3 code
   - Skip verification steps
   - Auto-run unsafe commands

2. **ALWAYS**
   - Document all changes
   - Test each component
   - Create recovery points
   - Follow implementation order

### Environment Configuration
```env
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3002
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=d2e773f7c1bd91f883a3a7c8d88d6c7e9a2f5b8e4c7d0a3f6b9c2e5h8k1m4n7
```

### Implementation Priority
1. Fix authentication system
2. Complete registration flow
3. Test email verification
4. Implement onboarding
5. Begin dashboard work

### Recovery Strategy
1. If authentication issues persist:
   - Consider downgrading Next.js
   - Try alternative auth solutions
   - Implement custom auth system

2. If development blocked:
   - Create new branch from clean state
   - Implement features one by one
   - Document each working state

- Fixed Prisma client initialization
- Added error handling for database operations

#### 3. Schema Fixes [12:50 - 13:00]
- Removed unique constraints from optional fields:
  - verificationToken
  - resetToken
- Fixed user creation data structure
- Successfully pushed schema changes to MongoDB

#### 4. Schema Cleanup [13:09]
- Removed duplicate User_v3 model from end of schema file
- Preserved working User_v3 model with all auth fields and relations
- Validated OnboardingState_v3 model structure
- Ensured all relations and mappings are correct

#### 5. Usage Model Fix [13:15]

- Ensured proper MongoDB ObjectId types and relations

### Current Working State
1. Registration endpoint (/api/auth/register) is functional
2. User creation works with proper error handling
3. Onboarding flow is accessible and shows role selection
4. Database schema supports all v3 features

### Test Case: Personal User Registration
1. Email: test999@quai.com
2. Status: Successfully registered
3. Current state: At onboarding welcome screen
4. Next step: Role selection (Personal User / Free Plan)

### Reversion Points
1. Last working schema: prisma/schema.prisma (current)
2. Schema backup: prisma/schema.prisma.pre_onboarding_2025_02_11_1310
3. Registration endpoint: src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts (current)
4. Database state: Clean with updated schema

### To Revert Changes
If onboarding flow fails:
```bash
# 1. Restore schema
cp prisma/schema.prisma.pre_onboarding_2025_02_11_1310 prisma/schema.prisma

# 2. Push previous schema
npx prisma db push

# 3. Regenerate client
npx prisma generate
```

### Dependencies
